# Challenge

1. For API testing I have not idea how to handle the negative test cases e.g if give 11-12-1980 as birthday then will get Failed for the negative test case while the expected result is failed
2. As a beginner I have no idea how to not hard code for the mulitple data, will learn it more.
3. Some times will get error e.g "locator xxx not found", need to double check the locator, I've added Extensions SelectorsHub and helped much, if keep gettsing same error then I will change the "click button/link" to "click element"
4. For the age between 75 and 76 how?
5. When age =18.01 then will use age <=18's variable to calculate
